# post-install
This a simple script to run after a Debian based install.
I use this after installing Ubuntu, Kali, Raspberry Pi, Xubuntu, and various others.

It's very simple...
<ul>
  <li>Download
  <li>chmod 777 post-install.sh
  <li>Edit the last block of lines in the post-install.sh, remove the installs you do not want.
  <li>./post-install.sh
</ul>

Done and done!
